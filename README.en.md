# Allright Orthopedics Queue Management System

A web app to manage patient queues and reservations in real time. Patients can register and monitor ETA; staff can view and edit the queue from an admin dashboard.

## Features

- Patient registration: name, age, service; generates a unique queue link
- Real-time queue view: ETA, progress, last updated, mobile-friendly
- Admin dashboard: list, edit, delete, complete, and quick stats (30s refresh)
- Masters: services, doctors, patients (stored in localStorage for now)
- Reservation (returning patients): basic visit check and calendar input

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui (Radix)
